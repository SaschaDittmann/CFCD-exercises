# CKAD Exercises

A set of exercises that helped me prepare for the [Cloud Foundry Certified Developer (CFCD)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/cloud-foundry-certified-developer-cfcd/) exam, offered by the Linux Foundation, organized by curriculum domain. They may as well serve as learning and practicing with Kubernetes.

During the exam, you are allowed to keep only one other browser tab open to access the following assets: 
- [docs.cloudfoundry.org](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/)
- [apidocs.cloudfoundry.org](https://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/)
- [v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org](http://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/)
- [plugins.cloudfoundry.org](https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/)

Make a mental note of the breadcrumb at the start of the excercise section, to quickly locate the relevant document in kubernetes.io. It is recommended that you read official documents before attempting exercises below it.
